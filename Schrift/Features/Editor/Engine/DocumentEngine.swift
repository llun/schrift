/// The headless document engine (B6a): the layer a native editor sits on.
///
/// **It borrows the replica; it never owns it.** The `YDoc` belongs to
/// `DocumentCollaborationManager` on the main actor (the one-owner rule), and
/// the engine only reads and writes it through the writer. When the owner
/// destroys the replica — a fail-safe, a suspend teardown — `YDoc.onDestroy`
/// fires and the engine detaches: its hooks are cleared, buffered patches are
/// dropped (even mid-delivery), and every later intent throws
/// `DocumentEngineError.detached`. Releasing the engine detaches it too. Nothing
/// here can touch a destroyed store.
///
/// **Buffering.** `YDoc.afterTransaction` runs inside the transaction's
/// observer phase, where a text delta is valid and the store is pre-gc/pre-merge.
/// The engine only *buffers* there. Delivery happens at `YDoc.afterAllTransactions`
/// — the outermost cleanup has finished, `doc.transaction` is nil, and a surface
/// that opens a transaction from `applyPatch` is queued and drained by the same
/// `transact` call, exactly as yjs does. A surface therefore never sees a patch
/// built from a half-cleaned store, and never runs mid-cleanup.
///
/// **Local intents emit patches too.** The engine does not suppress the patch
/// for the edit it just made: the same transaction may also carry a format
/// cleanup or a split's new block, and a surface that skipped it would drift.
/// A surface that already applied the keystroke itself reconciles; see
/// `EditorSurface`.
///
/// **Remote updates are the owner's.** The engine never applies a peer's
/// update: `DocumentCollaborationManager` owns the replica and calls
/// `doc.applyUpdate(_:origin: .remote)`. The engine observes the resulting
/// transaction like any other and patches the surface.
///
/// **Single consumer of the delivery hooks.** `afterAllTransactions` and
/// `onDestroy` are single-slot, so the engine asserts it is their only
/// consumer; `afterTransaction` is chained and restored on detach.
